bibmerge
========

Merges BibTeX (.bib) files into a single list of bibliography entries, removing
duplicates. The list is output to stdout.

Prior to parsing, files are sorted by modification time. Therefore, bib entries
from newer files will appear at the top of the resulting merged list.

The script also escapes common non-latin characters and newlines using LaTeX
native commands.
